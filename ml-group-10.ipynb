The dataset consists of protein abundance values derived from mass spectrometry readings of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gathered from several hundred patients. Each patient contributed several samples over the course of multiple years while they also took assessments of PD severity using the UPDRS scale.\n","\n","The reason why we are training only on the first month (visit_month == 0) is that the initial visit (month 0) provides a baseline measurement of PD severity for each patient. This baseline measurement can be used to train a model to predict the progression of PD over time using the protein abundance data.\n","\n","By training only on the first month, we can ensure that the model is predicting the progression of PD rather than simply fitting the noise in the data. Additionally, by using the initial visit as the baseline, we can avoid the potential confounding effects of medication or other factors that may impact the UPDRS scores at later visits.Therefore, we extract the UPDRS scores for the initial visit (month 0) for each patient and use this as the target variable for training our predictive

code is performing protein feature engineering by calculating aggregate features based on the NPX column for each visit in the proteins dataframe.\n","\n","Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n","\n","The groupby() method is used to group the proteins dataframe by visit_id.\n","\n","The agg() method is then used to apply aggregation functions to the UniProt, patient_id, and NPX columns for each group. For the UniProt and patient_id columns, the aggregation function used is nunique(), which counts the number of unique values in each column. For the NPX column, four aggregation functions are used: min(), max(), mean(), and std(). The resulting dataframe contains four columns: visit_id, UniProt, patient_id, and NPX. These columns represent the number of unique proteins and patients associated with each visit, and the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the normalized protein expression for all proteins associated with each visit.\n","\n","By calculating aggregate features based on the normalized protein expression for each protein, we can potentially identify trends and patterns in the relationship between protein expression and Parkinson's disease progression. These features can then be used as input features for a predictive model to improve the accuracy of the predictions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-03T22:53:57.006436Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-03T22:53:57.006049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-03T22:53:57.061131Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-03T22:53:57.059694Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-03T22:53:57.006400Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>visit_id</th>\n","      <th>NPX_min</th>\n","      <th>NPX_max</th>\n","      <th>NPX_mean</th>\n","      <th>NPX_std</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>10053_0</td>\n","      <td>2497.840</td>\n","      <td>269126000.0</td>\n","      <td>2.856580e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.131630e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>10053_12</td>\n","      <td>5800.870</td>\n","      <td>270030000.0</td>\n","      <td>2.728871e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.092162e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>10053_18</td>\n","      <td>1334.110</td>\n","      <td>278835000.0</td>\n","      <td>2.509967e+06</td>\n","      <td>1.969453e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>10138_12</td>\n","      <td>2520.240</td>\n","      <td>365582000.0</td>\n","      <td>3.002583e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.516170e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>10138_24</td>\n","      <td>1436.940</td>\n","      <td>396894000.0</td>\n","      <td>3.068891e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.716806e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1108</th>\n","      <td>8699_24</td>\n","      <td>756.551</td>\n","      <td>346067000.0</td>\n","      <td>3.064059e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.409420e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1109</th>\n","      <td>942_12</td>\n","      <td>1722.770</td>\n","      <td>330558000.0</td>\n","      <td>2.613298e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.295228e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1110</th>\n","      <td>942_24</td>\n","      <td>1339.150</td>\n","      <td>336769000.0</td>\n","      <td>2.616142e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.312662e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1111</th>\n","      <td>942_48</td>\n","      <td>1272.480</td>\n","      <td>358059000.0</td>\n","      <td>2.768442e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.460543e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1112</th>\n","      <td>942_6</td>\n","      <td>2491.690</td>\n","      <td>290111000.0</td>\n","      <td>2.476880e+06</td>\n","      <td>2.002174e+07</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>1113 rows × 5 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["      visit_id   NPX_min      NPX_max      NPX_mean       NPX_std\n","0      10053_0  2497.840  269126000.0  2.856580e+06  2.131630e+07\n","1     10053_12  5800.870  270030000.0  2.728871e+06  2.092162e+07\n","2     10053_18  1334.110  278835000.0  2.509967e+06  1.969453e+07\n","3     10138_12  2520.240  365582000.0  3.002583e+06  2.516170e+07\n","4     10138_24  1436.940  396894000.0  3.068891e+06  2.716806e+07\n","...        ...       ...          ...           ...           ...\n","1108   8699_24   756.551  346067000.0  3.064059e+06  2.409420e+07\n","1109    942_12  1722.770  330558000.0  2.613298e+06  2.295228e+07\n","1110    942_24  1339.150  336769000.0  2.616142e+06  2.312662e+07\n","1111    942_48  1272.480  358059000.0  2.768442e+06  2.460543e+07\n","1112     942_6  2491.690  290111000.0  2.476880e+06  2.002174e+07\n","\n","[1113 rows x 5 columns]"]},"execution_count":21,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["proteins_npx_ft = proteins.groupby('visit_id').agg(NPX_min=('NPX','min'), NPX_max=('NPX','max'), NPX_mean=('NPX','mean'), NPX_std=('NPX','std'))\\\n","                .reset_index()\n","proteins_npx_ft"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The code starts by grouping the proteins DataFrame by visit_id, and then aggregating the data for each group using the agg method.

Both of these algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features, and their performance can be affected if the features are on different scales. MinMax scaling ensures that all features have the same scale, which can improve the performance of these algorithms and help them find patterns in the data more efficiently.\n","\n","Non-normal distribution: It's mentioned that the train_0 data is not normally distributed. MinMaxScaler does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it more appropriate for this case than StandardScaler, which assumes a normal distribution.\n","\n","Consistency across different models: Since multiple models are being used in this code (Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Stacking model), using MinMaxScaler provides a consistent scaling approach across all of these models, making the results more comparable and easier to
