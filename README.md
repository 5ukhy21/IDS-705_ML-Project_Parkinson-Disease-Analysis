## Project Description
Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The progression of the disease is commonly measured using the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) scores, which assess motor and non-motor symptoms. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson's Disease (AMP-PD) Progression Prediction Kaggle competition seeks to discover unforeseen patterns and predict the progression of Parkinson's Disease using clinical UPDRS scores and peptide and protein abundance data captured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Unlike previous studies that have solely focused on statistical models and peptide/protein levels, our project and this data science competition will be unique in approach as it combines this information with clinical data and analyzes it all together, potentially contributing to a better understanding of the disease and ultimately leading to improved treatments for patients through UPDRS scores.

This study provides a detailed walkthrough of crucial assumptions made, the development of the predictive models, and the limitations for predicting UPDRS scores to determine Parkinson's Disease progression using peptide and protein abundance data from CSF samples. Analysis and findings from this data science competition can potentially lead to the development and breakthroughs of new medicines and medical techniques, such as specific pharmacotherapies, that aim to slow the progression or cure Parkinson's Disease.

## Data
This project consisted of 3 files: clinical trial data, peptide data, and protein data.
All associated training and test files are provided in the source repository `00_source_data`.

## How-To-Get-Started Guide
Open your terminal and run the following lines in order: 

1. `git clone git@github.com:5ukhy21/IDS-705_ML-Project_Parkinson-Disease-Analysis.git`

2. `cd 10_code`

From here you'll be able to run any of notebooks in the repository without any trouble (with the exception of changing directory of source data).

The notebook used to generated the results found from our report is `best score.ipynb`
